# CIS 260 Project

## Description

This website is part of a project for my CIS 260 course at Wilbur Wright College.

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to basically be a hub for the Valorant team: EG. Here, you can keep up with the players, matches, maps, and agents that they play. It's simply meant to be a fan website dedicated to the team.

## Disclaimer

This website is in no way officially associated with the esports org EG. This is simply something I created as a fan of the team.
