# CIS 260 Project

## Description

This website is part of a project for my CIS 260 course at Wilbur Wright College.

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to basically be a hub for the Valorant team: EG. Here, you can keep up with the players, matches, maps, and agents that they play. It's simply meant to be a fan website dedicated to the team.

## Disclaimer

This website is in no way officially associated with the esports org EG. This is simply something I created as a fan of the team.

# This is your README file.

I have uploaded this for you, it is customary to have a README file within GitHub to insure that there is some documentation. Please let me know if you needed any other help. Also this is written in a language called "Markdown". I have linked it here [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Please let me know if you needed any help. - Md Ali
